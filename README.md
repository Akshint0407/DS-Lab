# Data Science Practical Codes ‚Äì 3rd Year Engineering

This repository provides practical solutions and code samples for common Data Science (DS) lab assignments in the 3rd year of engineering. The aim is to help students easily access, understand, and implement DS concepts using Python.  
**Before starting any experiment, please check the specific aim and instructions from the lab manual provided by your respective university.**

## üìë Contents

1. **Data Wrangling I:**  
   Using Python (Pandas) on any open source dataset to perform data wrangling tasks such as loading, cleaning, and transforming data.

2. **Data Wrangling II:**  
   Create an ‚ÄúAcademic Performance‚Äù dataset of students and perform data wrangling operations such as handling missing values, renaming columns, and data type conversions.

3. **Descriptive Statistics I:**  
   Compute measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (variance, standard deviation) on any open source dataset.

4. **Descriptive Statistics II:**  
   Repeat the above statistical operations on another open source dataset for practice and comparison.

5. **Classification ‚Äì Logistic Regression:**  
   Perform classification using the Logistic Regression algorithm on the given dataset (`Social_Network_Ads.csv`).

6. **Classification ‚Äì Naive Bayes (I):**  
   Perform classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm on the `iris.csv` dataset.

7. **Text Analytics ‚Äì To perform text extraction and preprocessing on text using NLTK methods:**
   1. Extract sample documents and apply the following document preprocessing methods:  
      - Tokenization  
      - POS Tagging  
      - Stop Words Removal  
      - Stemming  
      - Lemmatization  
   2. Represent documents using:  
      - **Term Frequency (TF)**  
      - **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**  

8. **Data Visualization(I) ‚Äì Titanic Dataset:**
   To perform Data Visualization:
      1. Use the inbuilt `titanic` dataset to explore passenger data using **Seaborn**.  
      2. Plot a histogram to show the distribution of **ticket fare** (`fare` column).
   
10. **Data Visualization(II) ‚Äì Titanic Dataset:**  
   Additional visualizations on the Titanic dataset for deeper insights and practice.

11. **Data Visualization(III) ‚Äì Iris Dataset:**  
    Create various visualizations (scatter plots, pair plots, etc.) on the Iris dataset to explore relationships between features.
